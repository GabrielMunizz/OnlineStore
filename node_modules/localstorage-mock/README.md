 # localstorage-mock
 A mock implementation of [Window.localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage]).
 
 ### Usage
 1) Install package:
  - `npm i localstorage-mock --save-dev`
  
 2) Import / require module:
 - `import 'localstorage-mock'` or `require('localstorage-mock')`
 
 Mock should now be accessible globally as `localStorage`.
 
 
 ### API
 - `getItem(key)` - get item by key
 - `setItem(key, value)` - insert new item
 - `clear()` - clear storage
 - `length` - number of items in storage
 
 _Note: I realise there are already packages out there which implement local storage. I wrote this
 simply as a fun exercise in publishing my first npm module._
